I created a VR basketball game using Unity, C#, and GeoMagic Touch haptic technology to study how force feedback affects shooting accuracy. 
Through user testing, I explored its implications for sports training, therapy, gaming, and medical simulation.

This project demonstrates my skills in VR development, haptic technology, and data analysis, showcasing my contributions to enhancing user experiences in virtual environments.
